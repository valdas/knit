The Pyramid Texts are a collection of ancient Egyptian
religious texts from the time of the Old Kingdom.
Written in Old Egyptian, the pyramid texts were carved
on the walls and sarcophagi of the pyramids at Saqqara
during the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom.
The oldest of the texts date to between 2400-2300 BC.

Example:

 Oho! Oho! Rise up, O Teti!
 Take your head, collect your bones,
 Gather your limbs, shake the earth from your flesh!
 Take your bread that rots not, your beer that sours not,
 Stand at the gates that bar the common people!
