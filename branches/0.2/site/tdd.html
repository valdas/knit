If there is anything that is constant across all programming languages,
it is the need to test the code. Every programming has to be debugged.
</p>
<ul>
<li> "Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs."<br>-- Maurice Wilkes, 1949
</ul>
<p>
Wilkes is pointing out that the time required to debug a system is
surprisingly large- over half the effort of building.  According to
Brooks (The Mythical Man Month, 1995), the time required to build
software divides as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 1/3 in management and planning
<li> 1/6 in development
<li> 1/4 in unit test (testing all parts in isolation)
<li> 1/4 in system testing (testing all parts, in combination) 
</ul>
<p>
Decades later, the same distribution persists. It looks like this (the fractions
indicate how much of the development time is consumed by each activity):

</center>
</p>
<p>
For years I researched ways to reduce the cost of testing. With David
Owen, we tried some AI techniques for searching formal models for
violations to temporal logic queries.  With several other graduate
students (most notably, Justin diStefano) we tried data mining methods
to predict where to best focus the testing effort. All cool stuff, to
be sure, but the basic economics message of the above "v-diagram"
remains: testing consume around half your development time.
</p>
<a name="3"></a><h3>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/">Kent Beck</a> has decided to turn a vice into a virtue.  I read his
"test-driven development" (TDD) approach as something like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Granted: we will spend most of our development time testing the code.
<li> Consequently: redesign the development process around testing.
</ul>
<p>
In TDD, the <em>first</em> thing a programmer does on a new project is to
write a test that fails (the idea is to ensure that the test really
works and can catch an error).
Also, ideally, the programmer ends her day with a broken test. Next morning,
the first thing she does is run that test again, then works on fixing it.
This reduces the time requied to "swap in" at the start of the day.
</p>
<p>
TDD has rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li> PLANNING rules
<ul>
<ul>
<li> User stories are written. (a.k.a. lots of demos)
<li> Make frequent small releases (a.k.a. shows a string of demos)
<li> Fix it when it breaks (ak.a. code run break fix is the usual cycle)
</ul>
</ul>
<li> CODING rules
<ul>
<ul>
<li> Code the unit test first.
</ul>
</ul>
<li> TESTING rules
<ul>
<ul>
<li> All code must have unit tests.
<li> All code must pass all unit tests before it  can be released.
<li> When a bug is found tests are created.
<li> Acceptance tests are run often and the score is published.
</ul></ul></ul>
<p>
A shorter way of saying the above is this: red, green, refactor.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Red: find failed tests;
<li> Green: fix them;
<li> Refactor: sometimes, use the experience gained from all this testing  to reorganize and improve the code base.
</ul>
<p>
Two principles of TDD are "keep it simple, stupid" (KISS) and "You
ain't gonna need it" (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code
necessary to pass tests, designs can be cleaner and clearer than is
often achieved by other methods.  In
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530/103-2564761-2872664?v=glance&n=283155">Test-Driven Development by Example</a>, Kent Beck also suggests the
principle "Fake it, till you make it".
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h3>Demo-Driven Development</h3>
<p>
After reading Kent Beck's book "Test-driven development by Example", I
was struck with how small each test was. When checking oeprations on a
new abstract data type, just mini-tests are certainly
appropriate. However, when working with large granularity programs
(e.g. shell scripts), Kent-style tests seemed to small.
</p>
<p>
So in my mind,  I run a (small) variation to TDD. Think about how you might
present the code to someone else:
</p>
<ul>
<li> what you'd show off;
<li>  what you'd use to demonstrate the core principles. 
</ul>
<p>
This variant is called
"demo-driven development" and it differs from TDD in that each "demo"
is usually a seperate script comprising "large-grain tests" that
demonstrate some functionality.
Where as TDD demands thousands of tests,
DDD (demo-driven development) demands dozens (or less) of demonstration scripts.
</p>
<a name="5"></a><h2>Language-Indepedent Testing</h2>
<p>
Writing a harnass for TDD is very simple. Here, in its entirity, is the KNIT
Makefile for TDD. 
</p>
<pre>
 run : #: run one eg (via make u=test run)
	@$(MAKE) u=$u $u
 
 cache : #: run one eg and cache result (via make u=test cache)
	@$(MAKE) run  | tee $(Tests)/$u
	@echo new test result cached to $(Tests)/$u
 
 test : $(Tests)/$u #: test if the cached result is still current
	@echo $u >&2
	@$(MAKE) run | tee $(Tmp)/$u.got 
	@if  diff -s $(Tmp)/$u.got $(Tests)/$u > /dev/null;  \
		then echo PASSED $u ; \
		else echo FAILED $u,  got $(Tmp)/$u.got; \
	fi


 caches :  build #: run 'cache' on all egs
	@$(foreach x, $(Egs), $(MAKE) u=$x cache;) 
 
 tests : build #: run 'test' on all egs
	@$(foreach x, $(Egs), $(MAKE) u=$x test;) 
 
 score : #: run 'test' on all egs, collect the scores
	@$(MAKE) tests | egrep '(PASSED|FAILED)' \
         | $(Gawk) '{print $$1}' | uniq -c
</pre>
<p>
The code assumes some magic variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li> $(Egs) storing a set of test names. In KNIT, any Makefule rule starting with <tt>eg</tt> is a test and collected into <tt>$(Egs)</tt>.
<li> $(Tests) is a directory to stored expected test outcomes. By default, this is <tt>etc/tests</tt>.
</ul>

<a name="6"></a><h3>Using One Test</h3>

<a name="7"></a><h4>run</h4>
<p>
<tt>run</tt> executes one test. It tells the Makefile that the name of the test is <tt>$u</tt>, then it
runs that test. The following shows an example of running one example (called <tt>eg4</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
  make u=eg4 run
</pre>
<a name="8"></a><h4>cache</h4>
<p>
<tt>cache</tt> lets you define the expected  output of a test. Once you've run your code enough to
understand what it should be doing, you can cache that result; e.g.
</p>
<pre>
 make u=eg4 cache
</pre>
<p>
Note that, for hand-crafted test output, you should not cache the output. The output of (e.g.) eg4
can be generated manually and stored in $(Tests)/eg4.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h4>test</h4>
<p>
The <tt>test</tt> command compares the output of the test to the cache. If it is the same, then "PASSED" is printed.
Else, "FAIL" is printed.
</p>
<pre>
 make u=eg4 test
</pre>
<p>
The remaining rules (<tt>caches</tt>, <tt>tests</tt>, <tt>score</tt>) handle mulitple tests.
</p>
<a name="10"></a><h3>Using Multiple Tests</h3>

<a name="11"></a><h4>caches</h4>
<p>
<tt>caches</tt> is used when you are happy that all your tests are currently generating the
right output. In that happy case, you can reset the contents of all cached outputs with:
</p>
<pre>
 make caches
</pre>
<p>
Note: don't do this very often, since it blasts all your carefully written tests.
</p>
<a name="12"></a><h4>tests</h4>
<p>
This rule helps when the test outputs are really verbose. It runs all the tests,
but just prints the PASSED and FAILED information. It can be called with:
</p>
<pre>
 make tests
</pre>
<a name="13"></a><h4>score</h4>
<p>
This rule offers a final summary.  It runs all the tests,
but just prints the number of times  PASSED and FAILED were seen on the output.
It can be called with:
</p>
<pre>
 make score
</pre>
<a name="14"></a><h2>Hints on Writing Tests</h2>

<a name="15"></a><h3>How to name examples</h3>
<p>
All examples are Makefile rules. Each example starts with <tt>eg</tt>. There
are no spaces to the left of the example name. For example:
</p>
<pre>
 eg0: build
 eg1: eg0
    echo "I am the first test"
</pre>
<a name="16"></a><h3>eg0</h3>
<p>
Always write an eg0 that does any setup stuff needed before any test can run. E.g. in your app's <tt>Makefile</tt>,
it is common for <tt>eg0</tt> to build the system.
</p>
<pre>
 eg0 :
     build
</pre>
<p>
Then, make that <tt>eg0</tt> a depednent of all other tests. For example:
</p>
<pre>
 eg1 : eg0
     echo "I am the first test"
</pre>
<a name="17"></a><h3>Introduce yourself</h3>
<p>
Each test should start with <tt>$I;</tt> (which prints a little introduction script).
</p>
<pre>
 eg2 : eg0
     $I; echo "I am the first test"
</pre>
<a name="18"></a><h3>Spy on yourself</h3>
<p>
Tests can be <tt>$(Run)</tt>s or <tt>$(Spy)</tt>s. <tt>Run</tt> just <em>does</em>, while <tt>Spy</tt>
will <tt>Run</tt>, then print lots of debugging information. 
In the following example, some application has tests that
run the application using some command line flags:
</p>
<pre>
 -i $(Tests)/qualifiers.eg
</pre>
<p>
Exactly <em>what</em> the application does with those flags is not the point of this
example. What is relevant is the what is <em>different</em> about <tt>Run</tt>ing
and <tt>Spy</tt>ing:
						
 eg3 : eg0 
     $I; $(Run) -i $(Tests)/qualifiers.eg
 eg4 : eg0
     $I; $(Spy) -i $(Tests)/qualifiers.eg
</p>
<p>
The <tt>eg1</tt> rule just runs the application. However, the <tt>eg2</tt> rule generates 
a lot of debugging output.  The nature of
that debugging information is langauge-specific but, unless it is slow
to generate, it is best to always <tt>Spy</tt>.  
</p>
<a name="19"></a><h4>Spying with Awk</h4>
<p>
When <tt>Spy</tt>ing on Awk code, the code is called as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   $(Tmp)     = $(HOME)/tmp # defined in lib/make/dirs.mk
   $(Vars)    = $(Tmp)/vars.out 
   $(Profile) = $(Tmp)/profile.out
   $(Spy)     = $(Pgawk) --dump-variables="$(Vars)" \
                         --profile="$(Profile)" $(Loads) 
</pre>
<p>
So <tt>Spy</tt>ing on awk code dumps a list of the globals into <tt>$(Tmp)/vars.out</tt> and
a profile listing of how many times each lines was called into <tt>$(Profile)/profile.out</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Using  <tt>$(Tmp)/vars.out</tt>,
it is possible to  find variables that were meant to be local, but have escaped into the global space.
To do so, adopt the following coding convention: 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Label all your global variables as MixedCase 
<li> Label all your locals with a leading lowerCase letter.
</ul>
<p>
Then, once you've <tt>Spy</tt>-ed, the escaped locals will stand out in the <tt>$(Vars)</tt> entry.
</p>
<p>
Using <tt>$(Tmp)/profile.out</tt> is is possible to find hotspots or deadspots in the code. This profile output
lists how many times each line of code was called.  
</p>
<ul>
<li> If a line of code is never called by any test, it is  possibly dead code. 
<li> If a line of code is called (say) 1,000,000 times, then that is a clear candidate for optimization.
<li> If a line of code is a condition, and it is called (say) 100 times, but the body of the condition is never called, then maybe there is something wrong with the code.
</ul>
<p>
To get a quick viewing of the profile and the variables, use <tt>$(Dump)</tt>; e.g.
</p>
<pre>
 eg5 : eg0
     $I; $(Spy) -i $(Tests)/qualifiers.eg; $(Dump);
</pre>
<p>
This will dump <tt>$(Tmp)/profile.out</tt> and <tt>$(Tmp)/vars.out</tt> to the screen.
</p>
<a name="20"></a><h3>Writing one-liners</h3>
<p>
Sometimes, rather than test the whole application, the author wants to test one little function
(kind of a micro unit test). For this purpose, use <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$z$</tt>. e.g.
</p>
<pre>
 eg6 : build
        $I; $a help() $z
</pre>
<p>
If you want to <tt>$(Spy)</tt>, rather than just <tt>$(Run)</tt>, then use <tt>$A</tt> and <tt>$Z</tt> instead of <tt>$a</tt>, <tt>$z</tt>.
</p>
<a name="21"></a><h5>Writing one-liners in AWK</h5>
<p>
The above code orchestrates calling the above function in a BEGIN block, with the global <tt>TEST</tt> set to one:
</p>
<pre>
 #running
 a = $(Run) -v Test=1 --source 'BEGIN {#
 z = ; exit}'
 
 #spying
 A = $(Spy) -v Test=1  --source 'BEGIN {#
 Z = ; exit}'
</pre>
<a name="22"></a><h3>Calling a demo function</h3>
<p>
Also, if your code contains a function whose name starts with <tt>demo</tt>, then you can orchestrate calling that
code from a Makefile as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  make u=rss demo
</pre>
<p>
(XXXnote: currently broken)
</p>
<a name="23"></a><h3>Seed control</h3>
<p>
XXXL need notes on how to handle seeds.
