<h1>Test-Driven Development</h1>
<p>This tools of this site support a kind of test-driven development (TDD) called demo-driven development (DDD). In short, demos are like tests, but slightly bigger.
But what is TDD?

<p>According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development">WIKIPEDIA</a>:
<ul>
Test-driven development (TDD) requires the programmer to first fail
the test cases. The idea is to ensure that the test really works
and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the normal cycle will
commence. This has been coined the "Test-Driven Development Mantra",
known as red/green/refactor where red means fail and green is pass.
</ul>
<p>Test-driven development is Kent Beck's  <em>how-to</em> of one part of the
<em>extreme programming</em> approach to coding. 
Note that TDD does not require
extreme programming, but the reverse is certainly true. Consider the
<em>extreme rules</em> shown in 
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html</a>
and consider which of those rules depend on an active test program:
<ul>
<li>
PLANNING rules
<ul><li>
  User stories are written. (a.k.a. lots of demos)
  <li>Make frequent small releases (a.k.a. shows a string of demos)
  <li>Fix XP when it breaks (ak.a. code run break fix is the usual cycle)
</ul>
<li>
CODING rules
<ul>
<li>
  Code the unit test first.
</ul>
<li>
TESTING rules
<ul><li>
  All code must have unit tests.
 <li> All code must pass all unit tests before it  can be released.
  <li> When a bug is found tests are created.
  <li>Acceptance tests are run often and the score is published.
</ul>
</ul>

On reading Kent Beck's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530/103-2564761-2872664?v=glance&n=283155">Test-driven development</a>, it is clear
how small each test was. For example, when checking oeprations on a new
abstract data type, just mini-tests are certainly appropriate. However,
when working with large granularity programs ( e.g. shell scripts),
Kent-style tests seemed to small.
<p>
So DDD is a (small)  variation to TDD. Think about how you might
present the code to someone else, what you'd show off, what you'd use
to demonstrate the core principles. This variant is called "demo-driven
development" and it differs from TDD in that each "demo" is usually a
seperate shell script comprising "large-grain tests" that demonstrate
some functionality.
<p>
In short, TDD demands thousands of tests while DDD demands dozens (or less) of demonstration scripts.
