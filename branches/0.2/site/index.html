<h1>Welcome to the Art of Awk</h1>

<p>This site is, and is not, about the Awk programming language. 

<p>At first glance, it is a collection of tools and tricks for Awk (more specifcally, GNU Awk a.k.a gawk).
And if that is all you see, then you are missing out the art of Awk.
<p>
Awk is a magical language:
<ul>
	<li>The basics of the language can be  <a href="?keys2awk">learned in an hour</a>. 
	<li>It is invisible. 
	When you code something in Awk, the language disappears. You spend more time thinking about the structure of the problem
	than the complexities of the language (cause there aren't any:
	no continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc etc etc). 
</ul>
<p>So programming in Awk is a mediation on the essence of a problem, not the trivial details of over-elaborated languages.
The art of Awk is to explose the core issues by stripping away superflous detail.
<p>For example, I teach a third year university programming language subject. All the textbooks talk about <em>programming languages</em>
rather than <em>programmer tools</em>.
There is a world of difference between the two- one focuses on (e.g.) variable binding while the other asks "what are best programming practices
and how can we improve them"?. This site  explores best practices by trying to code them, as succinctly as possible, using Awk.
