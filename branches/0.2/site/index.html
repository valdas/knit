<h1>Welcome! Why are you Here?</h1>

<p>At first glance, this site seems to be just some tools &amp; tricks for AWK programmers.

<p>
But if that is all you see here, then you have not mastered the Art of AWK:
<ul>
<em>To reveal  simplicity, by stripping away the superfluous.</em>
</ul>

<p>
Programming in AWK is a study of the essential essence  of a problem (and 
not trivial and tedious
details of 
<a href="?onComplexity">over-elaborated implementation tools</a>).	When you code in AWK, you are thinking  about the problem, 
	not the complexities of the programming languages (because there aren't any:
	no continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc). 
<p>
AWK programs are very short to write and very quick to change.
This brevity lets you rapdily build and evolve prototypes- which gives you the
experience needed to uncover the correct design. 
<p>
So AWK programming is a test of your understanding of a problem.
When you really  understand it, then
everything suddenly becomes clear and clean and simple.
Hence: 
<ul>
<em><u>The rule of AWK</u>: keep AWKing till the code gets simple.</em>
</ul>
<p>
For example, there is no standard AWK development environment that supports development, testing, and documentation
by a distributed
community. So, we wrote one
in AWK (of course!), with a little help from some Unix scripting tools:
<ul>
<li><a href="?underconstruction">Domain-specific languages</a> for better <em>design and and analysis</em>;
<li><em>Writing</em> and documentation tools using  <a href="?literate">literate programming</a>;
<li>Simplier <em>builds</em> with <a href="?underconstruction">library management</a> tools;
<li>Continuous <em>unit testing</em> via  <a href="?tdd">test-driven development</a>;
<li><a href="?underconstruction">Data mining</a> tools for better <em>system testing</em>;
<li><a href="?underconstruction">Web-based content management</a> (with version control) for all the above.
<li>And we used the above to code up some sample  <a href="?underconstruction">applications</a>.
</ul>
<p>
What we found was that this was remarkably easy to do:
this is a 
part time project and the first release of this site was built using
80 minutes per day for three months (includes writing, testing, documentation) - about 2 weeks full time work.
Also, the resulting environment was not AWK-specific. 
For example, this
site offers mappings of these tools into LISP, SMALLTALK, PROLOG, PHP, PYTHON,..., and 
(of course) AWK.
So what started as a project to support AWK programming quickly became a project that supporting programming,
in any language.
<p>
When you review this code, you might be surprised at how easy it is to code these tools.
And that is the Art of AWK:
<ul>
<li> understanding something well enough...
<li>... so you can write it, just short enough, to get the job done.
</ul>
<p>And always remember:
<em>perfection is when there is nothing left to throw away</em><sup>1</sup>.
