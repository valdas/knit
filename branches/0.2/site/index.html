<h1>Welcome to the Art of Awk</h1>

<img src="``share``/img/easterEgg.jpg" class="rthumb250">
<p>This site is, and is not, about the AWK programming language. 

<p>At first glance, it is a collection of tools and tricks for Awk (more specifically, GNU Awk a.k.a gawk).
But if that is all you see here, then you have missed the art of Awk, namely:
<ul>
<em>To expose and simplify core issues by stripping away superfluous detail.</em>
</ul>
<p>
	When you code in AWK, you are thinking  about the problem, 
	not the complexities of the programming language (because there aren't any:
	no continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc). 
So programming in AWK is a study of the essential essence  of a problem (and not trivial and tedious
implementation details of over-elaborated languages).
<p>
AWK code is so short that it helps you quickly build and evolve prototypes. This gives you the
experience you need to find the right design principles.
If the code is complex in AWK, then usually you have not found
them yet. So our advice is to keep AWKing till the code gets simple.
<p>
For example, smart programmers know that they repeat the 
same tasks to solve different problems. And it make sense to build tools to support  those tasks. 
This site is about those tools, written in Awk (of course!). 
For more on those tools, see our <a href="?goals">goals</a>.
