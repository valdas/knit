<h1>Welcome to the Art of AWK</h1>

<img src="``share``/img/easterEgg.jpg" class="rthumb250">
<p>This site is, and is not, about the AWK programming language. 

<p>At first glance, it is a collection of tools and tricks for AWK (more specifically, GNU AWK a.k.a gawk).
But if that is all you see here, then you have missed the art of AWK, namely:
<ul>
<em>To expose and simplify core issues by stripping away superfluous detail.</em>
</ul>
<p>
	When you code in AWK, you are thinking  about the problem, 
	not the complexities of the programming language (because there aren't any:
	no continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc). 
So programming in AWK is a study of the essential essence  of a problem (and not trivial and tedious
implementation details of over-elaborated languages).
<p>
AWK code is so short that it helps you quickly build and evolve prototypes. This gives you the
experience you need to find the right design principles. Remember Teller's rule:
"as we understand more things, everything is becoming simpler"?
AWK is a test if you understand something. If you do then
everything suddenly becomes clear and clean.
So our advice is to keep AWKing till the code gets simple. 
<p>
For example, smart programmers know that they repeat the 
same tasks to solve different problems. 
It make sense to build tools to support  those tasks. 
This site is about those tools, written in AWK (of course!), with a little help from Bash and Make:
<ul>
<li><a href="?underconstruction">Domain-specific languages</a> for better <em>design and and analysis</em>;
<li><em>Writing</em> and documentation tools using  <a href="?literate">literate programming</a>;
<li>Simplier <em>builds</em> with <a href="?underconstruction">library management</a> tools;
<li>Continuous <em>unit testing</em> via  <a href="?tdd">test-driven development</a>;
<li><a href="?underconstruction">Data mining</a> tools for better <em>system testing</em>;
<li><a href="?underconstruction">Web-based content management</a> (with version control) for all the above.
</ul>
<p>Also, this site presents example  <a href="?underconstruction">applications</a>
that apply the above tools.
<p>
Much of the above can be applied to any scritping language. For example, this
site offers mappings of these tools into LISP, SMALLTALK, PROLOG, PHP, PYTHON,..., and 
(of course) AWK.
<p>
When you review this code, you might be surprised at how easy it is to code these tools.
And that is the Art of AWK:
<ul>
<li> understanding something well enough...
<li>... so you can write it, just short enough, to get the job done.
</ul>
<p>And always remember, 
<em>perfection is when there is nothing left to throw away</em> (Antoine de Saint-Exupery).
<h2>How to use this site</h2>
<p>Start with the <a href="?faqs">frequently asked questions</a>, then look at the
<a href="?install">install</a> page.
<!--- This site supports many tools (see below) and can be used in several ways. So you need to  decide how deep you want to go. 
You might consider do the simpler stuff (like layer1, below) before you move to the more elaborate stuff:

<p>Notes:<br>
<sup>1</sup> PENNY is a content management system and is short for "Penny for your thoughts".<br>
<sup>2</sup> KNIT is a integrated development environment that makes extensive use of command-line tools.
