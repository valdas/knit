<h1>Welcome to the Art of Awk</h1>

<p>This site is, and is not, about the Awk programming language. 

<p>At first glance, it is a collection of tools and tricks for Awk (more specifcally, GNU Awk a.k.a gawk).

<p>
<img src="``share``/img/easterEgg.jpg" class="rthumb250">But if that is all you see here, then you have missed the art of Awk:
<ul>
	<li>
The art of Awk is to expose core issues by stripping away superflous detail.
<li>
	When you code in Awk, you spend more time thinking about the structure of the problem
	than the complexities of the language (cause there aren't any:
	no continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc etc etc). 
<li>So programming in Awk is a study of the essential essence  of a problem (and not the trivial details of over-elaborated languages).
</ul>

<p>For example, I teach a third year university programming language subject. All the textbooks talk about <em>programming languages</em>
rather than <em>programmer tools</em>.
There is a world of difference between the two- one focuses on (e.g.) variable binding while the other asks "what are best programming practices
and how can we improve them"?. 
<p>
This site  explores the essence of programmin by trying to code them, as succinctly as possible, using Awk.
