<h1>Welcome! What do see?</h1>

<p>At first glance, this site seems to be just some tools &amp; tricks for AWK programmers.

<p>
But if that is all you see here, then you have not mastered the Art of AWK:
<ul>
<em>To reveal  simplicity, by stripping away the superfluous.</em>
</ul>
<img src="``share``/img/easterEgg.jpg" class="rthumb250">
<p>
Programming in AWK is a study of the essential essence  of a problem (and 
not trivial and tedious
details of 
<a href="?onComplexity">over-elaborated implementation tools</a>).	When you code in AWK, you are thinking  about the problem, 
	not the complexities of the programming languages (because there aren't any:
	no continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc). 
<p>
AWK programs are very short to write and very quick to change.
This brevity lets you rapdily build and evolve prototypes- which gives you the
experience needed to uncover the correct design. 
<p>
So AWK programming is a test of your understanding of a problem.
When you really  understand it, then
everything suddenly becomes clear and clean and simple.
Hence: 
<ul>
<em><u>The rule of AWK</u>: keep AWKing till the code gets simple.</em>
</ul>
<p>
Traditionally, AWK is viewed as a language for writing very short programs. This is strange since as far back as 1991
Henry Spencer<sup>1</sup> wrote that:
<ul>
<li>There is no fundamental reason why AWK programs have to be small "glue" programs.
<li>Even the "old" AWK is a powerful programming language in its own right.
<li>Effective use of its data structures and its stream-oriented structure takes some adjustment for C programmers, but the results can be quite striking.
</ul>
<p>To prove the point, he offered an AWK version of the Bell Labs NROFF tool. 
Since then,  apart from Spencer's work and a few others<sup>2</sup>, there are suspiciously few examples of large AWK programs.
<p>
Starting in early 2009, we've been the webmaster
of the <a href="http://awk.info">AWK community  portal</a>. 
Based on that experience, it is clear why there aren't many big AWK programs:
certain key tools are missing from the AWK-verse. Specifically, there is:
<ol>
<li>No standard for source code library management . Without a library of parts, you can't build larger assemblies;
<li>No standard for unit tests and regression tests. Without a way to exercise the code, you are reluctant to work as a team since you can't tell if someone else's latest change breaks your code. Worse, outsiders can't understands the code since you can't show off what it can do.
<li>No standard for documentation. Without documentation tools, no one outside the team can see what you've done
</ol>
Various tools addressed point (1), but there are no AWK tools that handle (1) and (2) and (3) in an integrated manner.
So we wrote those tools,
in AWK (of course!), with a little help from some Unix scripting tools. We found  that our "AWK" support tools
become tools for other languages, very easily.
That is, starting with AWK, we ended up with 
language-independent programmer support tools that work for
LISP, SMALLTALK, PROLOG, PHP, PYTHON, etc. 
<p>
We present here the result of that work: a very small language independent programmer's 
development environment, and numerous sample applications written using that environment.
When you review this code, you might be surprised at how easy it is to code, and customize, these tools. 
And that is the Art of AWK:
<ul>
<li> understanding something well enough...
<li> ... so you can write it, just short enough, to get the job done.
</ul>
<p>And always remember: <em>perfection is when there is nothing left to throw away</em><sup>3</sup>.
