<h1>Literate Programming</h1>
<p>Literate programming systems have the following properties.

<p><em>Code and extended, detailed, comments are intermingled.  </em>
Here, to write code,  just
start a new paragraph with a space or a tab.
And, to make comment writing easier,  we support a local variant of the MarkDown syntax called [?markup]. 

<p><em>The program and its documentation can be handsomely typeset into a single article that explains the program and how it works.</em>
Rather than typeset, we use HTML. But the results are the same: pretty displays of lots of code.

<p><em> The code sections can be written in whatever order is best for people to understand, and are re-ordered automatically when the computer needs to run the program.</em>
While this is not supported directly, code can be broken into many tiny files, then described in an order best suited for some narrative.
