According to <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/tchrist/litprog.html">Jason
Dominus</a>, literate programming systems have the following properties.
</p>
<p>
<em>Code and extended, detailed, comments are intermingled.</em>
Here, to write code, just start a new paragraph with a space or a tab.
All other paragraphs are comments and these are written in a
easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format called MARKUP (see below).
</p>
<p>
<em>The program and its documentation can be handsomely typeset into a
single article that explains the program and how it works.</em> Rather
than typeset, we use HTML. But the results are the same: pretty
displays of lots of code.
</p>
<p>
<em>The code sections can be written in whatever order is best for
people to understand, and are re-ordered automatically when the
computer needs to run the program.</em> This site does not support
this directly. However, code can be broken into many tiny files, then
described in an order best suited for some narrative.

<p>
MARKUP is based on John Gruber's excellent <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">MARKDOWN</a>
system, with small extensions to better support KNIT.
</p>
<p>
In MARKUP, the first two paragraphs are special. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> The first paragraph is completely ignored. This is useful if   the first para contains either directives or comments (e.g.  relating to copyright or version control).
<li> The second paragraph becomes the heading of the page.
</ul>
<p>
After that, paragraphs are rendered as HTML code.  If paragraphs start
with blanks or tabs, they are rendered verbatim (using the HTML
&lt;pre>) tag. Other paragraphs are rendered using full HTML (italics,
bolds, etc).
</p>
<p>
It is a useful to distinguish <em>two</em> kinds
of verbatims. Firstly, there is code that should be passed on to some interpreter/compiler.
Secondly, there is code that
