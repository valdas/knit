According to <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/tchrist/litprog.html">Jason
Dominus</a>, literate programming systems have the following properties.
</p>
<p>
<em>Code and extended, detailed, comments are intermingled.</em>
Here, to write code, just start a new paragraph with a space or a tab.
All other paragraphs are comments and these are written in a
easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format called MARKUP (see below).
</p>
<p>
<em>The program and its documentation can be handsomely typeset into a
single article that explains the program and how it works.</em> Rather
than typeset, we use HTML. But the results are the same: pretty
displays of lots of code.
</p>
<p>
<em>The code sections can be written in whatever order is best for
people to understand, and are re-ordered automatically when the
computer needs to run the program.</em> This site does not support
this directly. However, code can be broken into many tiny files, then
described in an order best suited for some narrative.

<a name="1"></a><h2>MARKUP (introduction)</h2>
<p>
MARKUP is based on John Gruber's excellent <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">MARKDOWN</a>
system, with small extensions to better support KNIT.
</p>
<p>
In MARKUP, the first two paragraphs are special. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> The first paragraph is completely ignored. This is useful if   the first para contains either directives or comments (e.g.  relating to copyright or version control).
<li> The second paragraph becomes the heading of the page.
</ul>
<p>
After that, paragraphs are rendered as HTML code.  If paragraphs start
with blanks or tabs, they are rendered verbatim (using the HTML
&lt;pre>) tag. Other paragraphs are rendered using full HTML (italics,
bolds, etc).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>Example</h2>

<a name="3"></a><h3>Input</h3>
<p>
In the following sample, para one is skipped, para two becomes the heading for the page, and the remaining text is rendered
in HTML
</p>
<pre>
  # -*- mode: Awk; -*-  vim: set filetype=awk : 
  #
  # This file is part of KNIT; copyright (C) 2010 by Tim Menzies

  This is the heading of this page


  An H1 Heading
  =============


  Paragraphs start after a blank line.


  + Lists are marked with a plus..
  + ... in the first column.


  Also, numbered lists start with left-hand-side numbers.


  1. Like this.
  1. The actual number does not matter.
  3. E.g. this list will be rendered as 1,2,3.


  Italics is marked by _underscores_ and bolds are marked by *stars*.


   function code(arg1,arg2) {
      # This para started with white space. 
      # So it will be rendered exactly.
      return arg1 + arg2
   }
</pre>
<a name="4"></a><h2>Syntax</h2>

<a name="5"></a><h3>Headings</h3>
<p>
Headings are marked up either in-line, or on their next-line:
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h4>In-line mark up</h4>
<p>
The following sample gets marked up as a big, not-so-big, smaller, smallest heading (respectively):
</p>
<pre>
  ===== BIG =====


  ==== Not-so-big ====


  === Smaller ===


  == Smallest ==
</pre>
<a name="7"></a><h4>Next-line mark up</h4>
<p>
The following sample gets marked up as a big, not-so-big, smaller, smallest heading (respectively):
</p>
<pre>
  BIG 
  ===


  Not-so-big 
  ==========


  Smaller
  =======


  Smallest
  ========
 
Notes

<a name="8"></a><h3>Mixing MARKUP with HTML</h3>
<p>
MARKUP does not alter  HTML tags (those starting with &lt;; e.g. 
"&lt;em>"). This means that for special rendering jobs (e.g. tables), 
it is possible to use HTML tags within MARKUP files.
</p>
<p>
Note one restriction: the table of contents generated on top of MARKUP file
will not include any heading tags that you enter as raw HTML; e.g.
&lt:h1>,
&lt:h2>,
&lt:h3>, etc.
</p>
<a name="9"></a><h3>Two Kinds of Verbatims</h3>

<ul>
<li> start code paragraphs with one character of whitespace 
<li> start vertbatim paragraphs with two whitespace characters.
</ul>
