<p>This site is devoted to simplicity, to minimalism in
programming. Why is that even interesting?

<p>Here's the deal. Software engineering researchers and developers

<p>More later. Whorf's hypothesis. Language as a weapon. Burnett's
history of programming languages. COCOMO numbers (language doesn't
matter).  Les Hatten (inheritance is bad).

<p>Keys results: massive simplicatations are possible.

<p>Counter-case: Guy Steele's LISP intepreters. Domain-specific
languages. shows that minor changes to the langauge have major impacts
on their utility and expressability. but here's the thing- should be
redone for every new domain. art of the meta-object protocol.
