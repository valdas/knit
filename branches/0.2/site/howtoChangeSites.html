To install a PENNY web site on a new URL, following these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Copy your current <a href="``Site``/../penny/index.cgi">penny/index.cgi</a> to a web-readable directory.
<li> Perform the local juju for making that makes that script web-executable (e.g. <tt>chmod u+rx index.cgi</tt>).
<li> In your local files, hunt down all paths that point to the old URL, and move them to the new URL.
<li> At any remote site that references your site, update the URLs.
<li> Remove index.cgi from your old site.
</ol>

Implementing the third step (changing URLs at your local site) is easy. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> In  <em>site/etc/config.txt,  update the  variables </em>home<em>.
<li> In  </em>site/etc/themes/*/index.html<em>, update any reference to the old URL. 
<li> Do the same in  </em>site/*.html<em>  and </em>doc/*.wak
</ul>
<p>
(Hint: in your  <em>*.html</em> and <em>*.wak</em> files, you can replace all explicit
references to the site with ``home``.).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>Chaning remote files</h2>
<p>
Implementing the fourth step (changing your URLs in remote sites), is a little more tedious. At the time of this writing, this site uses services
from
</p>
<ul>
<li> Blogger: for an rss feed to updates on this site).
<li> Disquss: for the comment system)
<li> Google: for a free site-specific search engine and to collect access statistics on the site.
</ul>
<p>
Sadly, none of those sites localize URL references so there it takes some time 
to track them all down and fix them. Sigh.
