<a name="1"></a><h2>Why use Awk?</h2>

<ul>
<li> Awk is a simple and elegant pattern scanning and processing language.
<li> Awk is also the most portable scripting language in existence.
<li> But why use it rather than Perl (or PHP or Ruby or...):
<ul>
<li> Awk is simpler (especially important if deciding which to learn first);
<li> Awk syntax is far more regular (another advantage for the beginner, even without considering syntax-highlighting editors);
<li> You may already know Awk well enough for the task at hand;
<li> You may have only Awk installed;
<li> Awk can be smaller, thus much quicker to execute for small programs.
</ul></ul>
<p>
(Other languages like Perl is) a good programming language for
writing self-contained programs, but pre-compilation and long
start-up time are worth paying only if once the program has loaded
it can do everything in one go. This contrasts sharply with the
Operator-stream Paradigm, where operators are chained together in
pipelines of two, three or more programs. The overhead associated
with initializing (say) Perl at every stage of the pipeline makes
pipelining inefficient. A better way of manipulating structured
ASCII files is to use the AWK programming language, which is much
smaller, more specialized for this task, and is very fast at startup.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Awk does not get in the way of generating solutions.  When
you code in Awk, you are thinking about the problem, not the
complexities of the language (because there aren't any: no
continuations, no inheritance, no pointers, no unions, etc). So
programming in Awk is a study of the essential essence of a problem
(and not trivial and tedious implementation details of over-elaborated
languages).

<a name="2"></a><h2>What is "KNIT"?</h2>
<p>
KNIT is a language independent IDE that integrates the following tools:
</p>
<p>
Writing tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>  KNIT files let programmers mix up comments and code using a simple mark-up language (e.g. paragraphs starting with a space are code, everything else is a comment.) We also offer many examples of domain-specific languages, and their use in software development.
</ul>
<p>
Building tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li> KNIT files know their dependencies and this site offers automatic tools to package together dependent files.
</ul>
<p>
Reading tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li> KNIT  supports web-browsing of code files. For example, all the pages at this site were auto-generated from KNIT source files.
</ul>
<p>
Testing tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li> After building, the output from a KNIT file can be cached. Test suites and regressions suites are now simple to implement: just re-run the code and comparing the output to the cache. We automate much of this process.
</ul>
<p>
Storing tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Using on-line version control.
</ul>

<a name="3"></a><h2>What is a "WAK" file?</h2>
<p>
Everything in KNIT starts with .wak files.
A ".wak" file is "words and kode", all mixed up. Based on Perl's POD files, WAK files let programmers mix up comments and code using a simple mark-up language (e.g. paragraphs starting with a space are code, everything else is a comment.) 
</p>
<p>
For more (albeit useless) information on "WAK", see the bottom of this FAQ.
</p>
<a name="4"></a><h2>What is a "MakeFile"?</h2>
<p>
WAK files live in a directory containing a Makefile. This file hooks
the WAK source into KNIT and contains tools for building and testing
the code.
</p>
<p>
Each directory contains code from one language (so if you are coding PHP and PYTHON), place them in different directories.
The Makefile defines what language is supported in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
KNIT's Makefiles all begin with the same four parts:
</p>
<pre>
 This    = quill# 1) define the app name
 Version = 0.1#   2) define the version number
 
 about:       #   3) Write an about line, with a copyright.
	@echo "A test engine for QUILL function $(This), v$(Version)"
	@echo "Copyright (c) GPL 3.0 2010 Tim Menzies, (tim at menzies dot us)"


 # 4) define this directory's language
 include $(knit)/lib/make/awk.mk # must be after defining "this" and "about"
 -----------------------------------------------
</pre>
<a name="5"></a><h2>What is "QUILL"?</h2>
<p>
QUILL is a library of useful AWK functions.
</p>
<a name="6"></a><h2>What is "PENNY"?</h2>
<p>
Penny, short for "penny for your thoughts" is the web browsing tool integrated into KNIT. When used with KNIT, it can display ".wak" files.
When used separately, it is  a simple way to display HTML files (which you can hand generate).
</p>
<a name="7"></a><h2>What else does "WAK" mean?</h2>
<p>
KNIT  processes "wak" files and, depending on your taste, "wak" means different things.
</p>
<p>
For AWK programmers, a wak is  "awk", all mixed up
</p>
<p>
For people who like doing violence to language, "WAK" is 
"words and kode" (code)
</p>
<p>
If your have street cred, then "WAK" means or super weird/awful/crazy/mad effed up
(from <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wak">the Urban Dictionary</a>).

<img class=rthumb250 src="http://cardboardmonocle.com/blog/fxsuits/wak.jpg">If you a fan of  the actor Henry Alvarez or the film "Explorers" (1985), then
"WAK" is an alien. According to
<a href="http://cardboardmonocle.com/blog/?page_id=747">Cardboard Monocle</a>,
at his core, Wak is a teenager. Though an alien, he has an annoying
little sister, watches a ton of television, and had more angst than
you can shake a latex eyeball on a stick at. Okay, so this is
another goofy 80s movie, but it has Ethan Hawke, River Phoenix and
a trash can spaceship. Plus, Wak has suction cup fingers.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if you are about 4000 years old and come from north Africa,
then "WAK" is  the
<a href="http://www.monamagick.com/resources<em>deities</em>african4.html">creator
god (in the mythology of southern Ethiopia, Uganda, and Somaliland)</a>
who dwelled in the clouds. He was supreme and a benefactor god. He
kept the heavens at a distance from the earth and ornamented it
with stars. When the earth was flat, Wak asked man to build himself
a coffin. Man did so and Wak shut him up in it and buried it. For
seven years he made fire rain down. This is how the mountains were
formed. Wak then danced upon the place where the coffin was buried
and man sprang forth, alive. He was sure he had slept for a brief
moment only and was shocked to find it had been so long and earth
had changed so much; this is why man is awake for most of the day.
Eventually man grew tired of living alone. Knowing of man's loneliness,
Wak took some of his blood and after four days, the blood turning
into a woman whom the man married. Man and woman had 30 children,
but man was so ashamed at having had so many that he hid fifteen
of them away. Wak was angry at this, and as a result, the children
man hid away were turned into animals and demons.
