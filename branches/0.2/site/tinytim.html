<p>
TINY TIM, s a tiny web-site manager written in AWK. 
</p>
<a name="1"></a><h2>Why</h2>
<p>
The code was written to demonstrate that a little AWK goes a long
way. At the time of this writing, the current system is under 100
lines of code (excluding a seperate formatter, that is another 170
lines of code). It took longer to write this doco and the various
HTML/CSS theme files, than the actual code itself (fyi: 6 hours for
the themes/doc and 3 hours for the code).
</p>
<a name="2"></a><h2>Features</h2>
<p>
TINY TIM has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
